ISSUE by @bugaevc

The README should clearly state:
*  whether or not this client is a complete **re-implementation**
* whether or not it includes **disassembled** code from the other Skype clients
* whether or not it is a **clean-room reverse-engineered** code, like Wine/ReactOS
* why the specified **license is valid** and legal to use for the project
* what are the **legal complications**, if any, to developing the project and to using it personally or commercially

REPLY ON ISSUE

> whether or not this client is a complete re-implementation

Yes. Its complete re-implementation of proprietary Skype Network protocol.

> whether or not it includes disassembled code from the other Skype clients

Well, may be a little :) unpack-4142.c and pack-4142.c is HexRays decompiled code. And should be rewritten... But i dont have time for this now.

> whether or not it is a clean-room reverse-engineered code, like Wine/ReactOS

No. Not clean room, not chinese wall.

> why the specified license is valid and legal to use for the project

Its my own code, i write it, i am the author of most code. And hold all copyrights rights.

Well, except some login pieces (skyauth3/skype_login.c) which copyrighted by Sean O'Neil from [VEST Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEST) in 2009. And RC4 reversing and implementation (skype_rc4.c/skype_rc4.h) also by Sean O'Neil.

> what are the legal complications, if any, to developing the project and to using it personally or commercially

1) The pack-4142.c/unpack41-42.c mentioned above. 
2) Also, it contain MIRACL for RSA and big numbers multiply arithmetics.
